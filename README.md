## How to Give Feedback

- **Found an error?** Open an issue describing the chapter, section, and what's wrong.
- **Have a suggestion?** Pull requests are welcome — even small fixes like typos or broken source paths.
- **Know a topic deeply?** We especially value feedback from engineers who work on specific AOSP subsystems.

## Quick Start

### Docker

```bash
./serve.sh           # start (http://localhost:8000)
./serve.sh off       # stop
./serve.sh status    # check if running
./serve.sh pdf       # build PDF → site/aosp-internals.pdf
./serve.sh epub      # build EPUB → site/aosp-internals.epub
```

The `pdf` command stops any running server, then builds all 64 chapters into a
single PDF with rendered Mermaid diagrams (takes a while — uses Playwright/Chromium).

The `epub` command works the same way, producing an EPUB3 file with rendered
Mermaid diagrams suitable for Apple Books, Google Play Books, and other readers.

### Without Docker

```bash
# Install (one-time)
pip install mkdocs-material pymdown-extensions

# Create symlinks (one-time)
mkdir -p docs
for f in [0-9]*.md A-*.md B-*.md index.md; do ln -sf "../$f" "docs/$f"; done

# Start
mkdocs serve                       # http://127.0.0.1:8000

# Build static site
mkdocs build                       # output in site/
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** — chapters in the sidebar, Mermaid renders live, hot-reload on edits.

## GitHub Actions

Tests `mkdocs build` on push to `main` and PRs (~2 min).
