## How to Give Feedback

- **Found an error?** Open an issue describing the chapter, section, and what's wrong.
- **Have a suggestion?** Pull requests are welcome — even small fixes like typos or broken source paths.
- **Know a topic deeply?** We especially value feedback from engineers who work on specific AOSP subsystems.

## Quick Start

### Docker

```bash
./serve.sh           # start (http://localhost:8000)
./serve.sh off       # stop
./serve.sh status    # check if running
./serve.sh pdf       # build PDF → site/aosp-internals.pdf
./serve.sh epub      # build EPUB → site/aosp-internals.epub
```

The `pdf` command stops any running server, then builds all 64 chapters into a
single PDF with rendered Mermaid diagrams (takes a while — uses Playwright/Chromium).

The `epub` command works the same way, producing an EPUB3 file with rendered
Mermaid diagrams suitable for Apple Books, Google Play Books, and other readers.

### Without Docker

```bash
# Install (one-time)
pip install mkdocs-material pymdown-extensions

# Create symlinks (one-time)
mkdir -p docs
for f in [0-9]*.md A-*.md B-*.md index.md; do ln -sf "../$f" "docs/$f"; done

# Start
mkdocs serve                       # http://127.0.0.1:8000

# Build static site
mkdocs build                       # output in site/
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** — chapters in the sidebar, Mermaid renders live, hot-reload on edits.

## AOSP Manifest Snapshots

A companion tool captures point-in-time, fully-pinned `repo manifest` snapshots of the AOSP source tree and diffs two of them into a per-project commit-list Markdown report grouped by module group. Useful for "what changed between two AOSP releases."

```bash
# Take a snapshot (resolves every <project> to a HEAD SHA, prompts for label/notes)
python3 tools/manifest_snapshot.py snap --aosp-root /path/to/aosp

# Compare two snapshots → manifest-snapshots/_compare/<A>__vs__<B>.md
python3 tools/manifest_snapshot.py compare \
    manifest-snapshots/<branch>/<date-A> \
    manifest-snapshots/<branch>/<date-B> \
    --aosp-root /path/to/aosp
```

The tool is read-only against `.repo/` — it never writes inside the AOSP checkout. See [`manifest-snapshots/README.md`](manifest-snapshots/README.md) for the full guide, flag reference, and the read-only guarantee.

## GitHub Actions

Tests `mkdocs build` on push to `main` and PRs (~2 min).
