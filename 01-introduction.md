## 1.1 Why This Book Exists

The Android Open Source Project is one of the largest, most complex, and most
consequential open-source projects in human history. It powers over three billion
active devices, from phones and tablets to televisions, cars, wearables, and
embedded systems. Its codebase spans hundreds of millions of lines of code across
thousands of Git repositories. Its architecture bridges a Linux kernel written in
C with a Java/Kotlin application framework, connected by native C++ services, a
custom IPC mechanism (Binder), and a purpose-built runtime (ART).

And yet, for all its ubiquity, AOSP remains poorly understood -- even among
experienced Android application developers. The typical Android developer
interacts with AOSP through a narrow window: the SDK APIs documented on
developer.android.com. What lies beneath those APIs -- the services, the native
daemons, the hardware abstraction layers, the kernel drivers, the build system
that stitches it all together -- is a world that few developers explore and fewer
still can navigate with confidence.

This book exists to change that.

Whether you are a system engineer at an OEM, a silicon vendor integrating a new
SoC, a ROM developer building a custom distribution, a security researcher
analyzing the platform, or simply a curious application developer who wants to
understand what happens when you call `startActivity()`, this book will give you
the knowledge you need to read, understand, modify, build, and debug AOSP.

This first chapter sets the stage. We will define precisely what AOSP is (and
what it is not), survey the architecture from kernel to application, walk through
the source tree directory by directory, establish who maintains what, review the
platform's version history, and lay out the roadmap for the rest of the book.

## 1.2 What is AOSP vs. Android

The terms "AOSP" and "Android" are often used interchangeably, but they refer to
different things. Understanding the distinction is fundamental to working with
the platform at the source level.

### 1.2.1 AOSP: The Open-Source Foundation

AOSP -- the **Android Open Source Project** -- is the complete, buildable,
open-source operating system that Google releases under the Apache 2.0 license
(with some components under GPL, LGPL, and BSD licenses). It includes:

- A **Linux kernel** (with Android-specific patches)
- A **C library** (Bionic, Android's custom libc)
- A **native runtime** and native services (SurfaceFlinger, AudioFlinger,
  InputFlinger, and dozens more)
- The **Android Runtime** (ART), which executes application bytecode
- The **Java/Kotlin framework** (the `android.*` APIs that application developers
  use)
- A **build system** (Soong/Blueprint with legacy Make support)
- **System applications** (Settings, Launcher3, SystemUI, Contacts, Dialer,
  Camera, Calendar, and more)
- A **Compatibility Test Suite** (CTS) that defines what it means to be
  "Android-compatible"
- **Hardware Abstraction Layers** (HALs) with reference implementations
- **Developer tools** (adb, fastboot, emulator configurations)

You can download AOSP, build it, and flash it onto supported hardware (primarily
Google's reference devices and the Android Emulator) without any involvement from
Google beyond accessing the source repositories. The result is a fully functional
operating system -- but it is not the "Android" that consumers know.

### 1.2.2 Google Mobile Services: The Proprietary Layer

The Android that ships on most consumer devices includes a substantial proprietary
layer from Google called **Google Mobile Services (GMS)**. This layer includes:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Google Play Store** | The primary application marketplace |
| **Google Play Services** | Background service providing APIs for location, auth, push notifications (FCM), SafetyNet/Play Integrity, and hundreds more |
| **Google Search / Assistant** | Voice assistant and search integration |
| **Chrome** | The default browser (replaces AOSP Browser2) |
| **Gmail** | Email client (replaces AOSP Email) |
| **Google Maps** | Mapping and navigation |
| **YouTube** | Video streaming |
| **Google Photos** | Photo management (replaces AOSP Gallery) |
| **Google Play Protect** | Security scanning |
| **Google Dialer / Contacts** | Enhanced versions of AOSP apps |
| **SetupWizard** | The first-boot experience |

GMS is not open source. It is licensed to OEMs through a legal agreement called
the **Mobile Application Distribution Agreement (MADA)**, which historically
requires OEMs to bundle a minimum set of Google applications and place them in
specific locations (e.g., Google Search on the home screen). The **Android
Compatibility Definition Document (CDD)** and **CTS** set the technical
requirements; MADA sets the business requirements.

This distinction has significant implications:

1. **AOSP alone is "degoogled."** If you build AOSP from source without adding
   GMS, you get a functional OS with no Google account integration, no Play Store,
   no push notifications via FCM, and no Google-dependent APIs. Many apps from
   the Play Store will not function correctly because they depend on Google Play
   Services.

2. **Custom ROMs operate in this gap.** Projects like LineageOS, GrapheneOS,
   CalyxOS, and /e/OS build from AOSP and either exclude GMS entirely, include
   it optionally (via packages like Open GApps or MindTheGapps), or replace its
   functionality with open-source alternatives (microG).

3. **Huawei/Honor is the most prominent example of AOSP-without-GMS at scale.**
   After US trade restrictions prevented Google from licensing GMS to Huawei, the
   company shipped devices running AOSP with its own Huawei Mobile Services (HMS)
   and AppGallery store.

### 1.2.3 The OEM Layer: Vendor Customizations

Between AOSP and the consumer device lies another layer: the **OEM
customization**. Major OEMs apply extensive modifications:

| OEM | Customization Brand | Key Modifications |
|---|---|---|
| **Samsung** | One UI | Custom SystemUI, multi-window enhancements, DeX desktop mode, Knox security, S Pen integration, custom camera stack |
| **Xiaomi** | MIUI / HyperOS | Heavily customized UI, custom launcher, control center, security app, dual-app support |
| **OPPO/OnePlus** | ColorOS / OxygenOS | Custom AOD, shelf, Zen Mode, custom gallery and camera |
| **Google** | Pixel Experience | Material You theming, Pixel Launcher, Pixel-exclusive features, Tensor-specific optimizations |
| **Huawei** | EMUI / HarmonyOS | Custom everything -- Huawei progressively replaced AOSP with their own stack |
| **Sony** | Stock-like | Relatively close to AOSP with camera, audio, and display enhancements |
| **Motorola** | My UX | Near-stock with gesture additions (chop for flashlight, twist for camera) |

These customizations touch every layer of the stack: kernel (custom drivers,
scheduler tweaks), HAL (proprietary camera, audio, and display implementations),
framework (custom system services), SystemUI (custom status bar, quick settings,
lock screen), and applications (custom launcher, gallery, camera, settings).

### 1.2.4 The Complete Picture

The full Android stack on a consumer device can be understood as three concentric
layers:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Consumer["Consumer Device (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S25)"]
        subgraph OEM["OEM Layer (One UI / MIUI / ColorOS / etc.)"]
            OEM_UI["Custom SystemUI, Launcher, Settings"]
            OEM_FW["Framework Extensions"]
            OEM_HAL["Proprietary HALs & Drivers"]
        end
        subgraph GMS["Google Mobile Services"]
            PlayStore["Play Store"]
            PlayServices["Play Services"]
            GoogleApps["Google Apps (Gmail, Maps, Chrome, etc.)"]
        end
        subgraph AOSP_Layer["AOSP (Open Source)"]
            Framework["Framework APIs (android.*)"]
            Runtime["ART Runtime"]
            NativeServices["Native Services"]
            HAL["Hardware Abstraction Layer"]
            Kernel["Linux Kernel"]
        end
    end

    OEM_UI --> GMS
    OEM_FW --> AOSP_Layer
    OEM_HAL --> Kernel
    GMS --> Framework
    Framework --> Runtime
    Runtime --> NativeServices
    NativeServices --> HAL
    HAL --> Kernel

    style AOSP_Layer fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style GMS fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0
    style OEM fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c62828
    style Consumer fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#e65100
```

**Key insight for this book:** We focus almost exclusively on the green layer --
AOSP itself. This is where the operating system lives. GMS and OEM modifications
are built on top of it, and understanding AOSP is prerequisite to understanding
either of them.

### 1.2.5 AOSP Licensing

AOSP is not under a single license. Different components use different licenses,
reflecting their origins:

| Component | License | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Linux Kernel | GPLv2 | Inherited from upstream Linux |
| Bionic (libc) | BSD | Avoids GPL contamination of userspace; allows proprietary apps |
| Framework (Java) | Apache 2.0 | Permissive; allows OEM modification without source disclosure |
| ART | Apache 2.0 | Same as framework |
| Toolchain (LLVM/Clang) | Apache 2.0 with LLVM exception | Upstream LLVM license |
| External libraries | Various | Each library retains its original license (MIT, BSD, LGPL, etc.) |
| CTS | Apache 2.0 | Allows OEMs to run tests without license concerns |
| SELinux policies | Public Domain | Derived from upstream SELinux |

The deliberate choice of BSD for Bionic (instead of glibc's LGPL) was a
foundational decision that made it legally safe for proprietary applications and
proprietary HAL implementations to link against Android's C library without
triggering copyleft obligations. This decision is one of the reasons the mobile
ecosystem could adopt Android while maintaining proprietary drivers and
applications.

## 1.3 The AOSP Layer Cake: System Architecture

Android's architecture is a layered stack, where each layer provides services to
the layer above it and consumes services from the layer below. Understanding this
stack -- what lives where, what communicates with what, and through which
mechanisms -- is the single most important conceptual foundation for working with
AOSP.

Let us examine each layer in detail, from the bottom up.

### 1.3.2 Layer 1: The Linux Kernel

Android runs on the Linux kernel. As of Android 15, the kernel is based on the
**Linux 6.x Long-Term Support (LTS)** branch with Android-specific patches
managed through the **Android Common Kernel (ACK)** and the **Generic Kernel
Image (GKI)** initiative.

#### Android-Specific Kernel Features

The Android kernel is not vanilla Linux. It includes several Android-specific
subsystems and drivers:

| Feature | Purpose | Source Location |
|---|---|---|
| **Binder** | Android's primary IPC mechanism. A kernel driver that provides transaction-based communication between processes. Three devices: `/dev/binder` (framework), `/dev/hwbinder` (HAL), `/dev/vndbinder` (vendor). | `drivers/android/binder.c` in kernel |
| **Ashmem / memfd** | Anonymous shared memory. Originally `ashmem`, now transitioning to standard Linux `memfd_create`. Used for sharing large data between processes (e.g., GraphicBuffer). | `drivers/staging/android/` (legacy) |
| **ION / DMA-BUF Heaps** | Memory allocator for hardware buffers (GPU, camera, display). ION was Android-specific; DMA-BUF heaps is the upstream-friendly replacement. | `drivers/dma-buf/` |
| **Low Memory Killer** | Kills background processes under memory pressure. Originally Android-specific (`lowmemorykiller`), now uses userspace `lmkd` with kernel's PSI (Pressure Stall Information). | Userspace: `system/memory/lmkd/` |
| **fuse (for storage)** | FUSE filesystem provides the scoped storage layer. Performance-critical path for app file access. | Standard kernel fuse |
| **dm-verity** | Verified boot. Ensures system partitions haven't been tampered with. | `drivers/md/dm-verity*` |
| **SELinux** | Mandatory access control. Android uses a strict SELinux policy that confines every process. | Policy: `system/sepolicy/` |

#### Generic Kernel Image (GKI)

Starting with Android 12, Google introduced the **GKI** architecture to solve
kernel fragmentation. The idea:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Before["Before GKI"]
        Upstream1["Upstream Linux LTS"] --> ACK1["Android Common Kernel"]
        ACK1 --> SoC1["SoC Kernel<br/>(Qualcomm / MediaTek / Samsung)"]
        SoC1 --> OEM1["OEM Kernel<br/>(Samsung / Xiaomi / etc.)"]
    end

    subgraph After["With GKI"]
        Upstream2["Upstream Linux LTS"] --> ACK2["Android Common Kernel"]
        ACK2 --> GKI2["Generic Kernel Image<br/>(Google-maintained, signed)"]
        GKI2 --> Modules["Vendor Modules<br/>(Loadable kernel modules<br/>for SoC/OEM drivers)"]
    end

    style Before fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c62828
    style After fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
```

Before GKI, each device had a unique kernel: upstream Linux LTS was forked by
Google (ACK), then forked again by the SoC vendor (e.g., Qualcomm's `msm-kernel`),
then forked again by the OEM. This created massive fragmentation -- devices
shipped with kernels that were years behind upstream, and security patches took
months to propagate.

GKI provides a single, Google-built kernel binary that is common across all
devices using the same Android version and kernel version. Vendor-specific
functionality is delivered as **loadable kernel modules (LKMs)** and
**vendor_dlkm** (vendor dynamically loaded kernel modules) on a separate
partition. This means Google can update the kernel independently of vendors.

In the AOSP source tree, kernel-related content lives in:

- `kernel/configs/` -- GKI kernel configuration fragments
- `kernel/prebuilts/` -- Prebuilt kernel images for development
- `kernel/tests/` -- Kernel test suites

The actual kernel source is typically obtained separately via a kernel manifest
(`repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/manifest`) because it is
extremely large and most platform developers do not need to modify it.

### 1.3.3 Layer 2: Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

The HAL is the interface between Android's userspace and hardware-specific
drivers. It allows Android to run on diverse hardware without modifying the
framework.

#### HAL Architecture Evolution

Android's HAL architecture has evolved significantly:

```mermaid
timeline
    title HAL Architecture Evolution
    section Legacy (Android 1.0 - 7.x)
        2008-2016 : C-struct HALs
                   : hw_module_t / hw_device_t
                   : Loaded via dlopen() in-process
                   : No versioning, no stability
    section HIDL (Android 8.0 - 12)
        2017-2021 : Hardware Interface Definition Language
                   : Out-of-process HAL services
                   : hwbinder transport
                   : Strict versioning (major.minor)
                   : Enables Treble: framework/vendor split
    section AIDL (Android 11+)
        2020-present : Android Interface Definition Language
                      : Replaces HIDL for new HALs
                      : Uses standard binder transport
                      : Unified language for framework + HAL IPC
                      : NDK backend for vendor stability
```

**Legacy HALs** (pre-Treble) were shared libraries loaded directly into the
calling process. The camera HAL, for example, was a `.so` file loaded into
`cameraserver` via `dlopen()`. This worked, but meant the HAL and the framework
were tightly coupled -- updating one required updating the other.

**Project Treble** (Android 8.0) introduced **HIDL (Hardware Interface
Definition Language)**, which moved HALs into separate processes communicating
over `hwbinder`. This created a stable, versioned interface between the framework
and vendor implementations, enabling:

- **Faster OS updates**: OEMs could update the Android framework without
  modifying vendor HALs
- **Generic System Images (GSI)**: A single system image that works across
  multiple devices
- **Vendor Test Suite (VTS)**: Automated testing of HAL implementations

**Stable AIDL** (Android 11+) is now the preferred HAL interface language. It
uses the same AIDL that has been used for years in application-to-framework IPC,
but with a stable **NDK backend** that vendors can implement against. New HALs
must be written in AIDL; HIDL is frozen and will not accept new interfaces.

#### HAL Interface Directory

The canonical HAL interface definitions live in `hardware/interfaces/`:

```
hardware/interfaces/
    audio/              -- Audio HAL (capture, playback, effects)
    automotive/         -- Automotive-specific HALs (vehicle, EVS)
    biometrics/         -- Fingerprint, face authentication
    bluetooth/          -- Bluetooth HAL
    boot/               -- Boot control HAL (A/B updates)
    broadcastradio/     -- FM/AM radio
    camera/             -- Camera HAL (camera2 API backend)
    cas/                -- Conditional Access System (DRM for broadcast)
    confirmationui/     -- Trusted UI confirmation
    contexthub/         -- Context Hub (always-on sensor processor)
    drm/                -- DRM plugin HAL (Widevine, etc.)
    dumpstate/          -- Bug report generation
    fastboot/           -- Fastboot HAL
    gatekeeper/         -- Password/PIN verification

        allocator/      --   Gralloc (buffer allocation)
        composer/       --   HWC (hardware composer for display)
        mapper/         --   Buffer mapping
    health/             -- Battery/charging health
    identity/           -- Identity credential
    input/              -- Input classifier
    ir/                 -- Infrared (IR blaster)
    keymaster/          -- Cryptographic key management
    light/              -- LED/backlight control
    media/              -- Media codec (OMX/Codec2)
    memtrack/           -- Memory tracking
    neuralnetworks/     -- NNAPI (ML acceleration)
    nfc/                -- NFC
    power/              -- Power management, power hints
    radio/              -- Telephony radio (RIL replacement)
    secure_element/     -- Secure element access
    sensors/            -- Sensor HAL (accelerometer, gyro, etc.)
    soundtrigger/       -- Hotword detection
    thermal/            -- Thermal management
    tv/                 -- TV input framework
    usb/                -- USB HAL
    vibrator/           -- Haptic feedback
    wifi/               -- Wi-Fi HAL
    ... and more (60+ HAL interfaces total)
```

Each HAL interface directory contains `.aidl` or `.hal` files that define the
interface, along with default implementations and VTS (Vendor Test Suite) tests.

#### The Treble Boundary: VNDK and Vendor Partition

Project Treble established a hard boundary between the **system partition**
(framework, updated by Google/OEM) and the **vendor partition** (HALs/drivers,
updated by SoC vendor):

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph System_Partition["System Partition (/system)"]
        FW["Framework"]
        SS["System Services"]
        SysApps["System Apps"]
    end

    subgraph Vendor_Partition["Vendor Partition (/vendor)"]
        VendorHALs["Vendor HAL<br/>Implementations"]
        VendorLibs["Vendor Libraries"]
        VendorFW["Vendor Firmware"]
    end

    subgraph Interfaces["Stable Interfaces"]
        AIDL_IF["AIDL HAL Interfaces"]
        HIDL_IF["HIDL HAL Interfaces"]
        VNDK["VNDK<br/>(Vendor NDK: stable<br/>system libraries)"]
    end

    System_Partition <--> Interfaces
    Interfaces <--> Vendor_Partition

    style System_Partition fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style Vendor_Partition fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2
    style Interfaces fill:#fff9c4,stroke:#f9a825
```

The **VNDK (Vendor NDK)** is the set of system libraries that vendor code is
allowed to link against. Vendor code cannot link against arbitrary system
libraries -- only those in the VNDK. This is enforced at build time and at
runtime through **linker namespaces** (configured in `system/linkerconfig/`).

### 1.3.4 Layer 3: Native Services and Libraries

Above the kernel and HALs sits a rich layer of native (C/C++) services and
libraries. These are the workhorses of the system -- they handle display
composition, audio mixing, input dispatch, media playback, and more.

#### Core Native Services

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph NativeServices["Native Services (C/C++)"]
        SF["SurfaceFlinger<br/><i>frameworks/native/services/<br/>surfaceflinger/</i>"]
        AF["AudioFlinger<br/><i>frameworks/av/services/<br/>audioflinger/</i>"]

    end

    NativeLibs --> BionicLib

    style NativeServices fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#0277bd
    style NativeLibs fill:#e0f7fa,stroke:#00695c
```

Let us examine the most important native services:

**SurfaceFlinger** (`frameworks/native/services/surfaceflinger/`) is the display
compositor. Every frame you see on an Android device is composed by
SurfaceFlinger. It receives buffers from application windows (via the
`BufferQueue` mechanism), composites them together using either the GPU
(client composition) or the display hardware (hardware composition via HWC HAL),
and sends the final frame to the display. SurfaceFlinger manages multiple
displays, handles VSYNC timing, and coordinates with the WindowManagerService in
system_server for window layout and visibility.

**AudioFlinger** (`frameworks/av/services/audioflinger/`) is the audio mixer and
router. It receives audio data from applications and system services, mixes
multiple audio streams according to their types (music, notification, alarm,
voice call), applies effects, and routes the mixed audio to the appropriate
output device via the Audio HAL. It handles sample rate conversion, channel
mapping, and latency management.

**InputFlinger** (`frameworks/native/services/inputflinger/`) reads raw input
events from the kernel's `/dev/input/` devices (touch, keyboard, mouse, gamepad),
classifies them, and dispatches them to the correct window. The **InputDispatcher**
component maintains a mapping of windows to input channels and ensures that touch
events reach the window under the touch point, keyboard events reach the focused
window, and system gestures (back, home, recent apps) are intercepted before
reaching applications.

**CameraService** (`frameworks/av/services/camera/`) mediates between the Camera2
API (used by applications) and the Camera HAL (implemented by vendors). It
manages camera device lifecycle, request processing, and stream management.

**MediaPlayerService / MediaCodecService** (`frameworks/av/`) provides media
playback and encoding. The Codec2 framework (successor to the original OMX/Stagefright
architecture) manages hardware and software codecs for video and audio.

**ServiceManager** (`frameworks/native/cmds/servicemanager/`) is the native Binder
service registry. Every system service that wants to be accessible over Binder
registers itself with ServiceManager. Clients look up services by name. There are
actually three ServiceManagers: one for framework binder (`/dev/binder`), one for
HW binder (`/dev/hwbinder`, managed by `hwservicemanager`), and one for vendor
binder (`/dev/vndbinder`, managed by `vndservicemanager`).

#### Bionic: Android's C Library

Bionic (`bionic/`) is Android's custom C library. It is *not* glibc. Bionic was
written from scratch (incorporating code from BSD) with specific goals:

1. **Small size**: Mobile devices have limited memory. Bionic is significantly
   smaller than glibc.
2. **Fast startup**: `dlopen()`, `pthread_create()`, and other common operations
   are optimized for mobile workloads.
3. **BSD license**: Avoids LGPL, which would require OEMs to provide a way for
   users to replace the C library.
4. **Android-specific features**: Properties system (`__system_property_get`),
   Android logging (`__android_log_print`), Binder support.

Bionic includes:

- `bionic/libc/` -- The C library itself
- `bionic/libm/` -- Math library
- `bionic/libdl/` -- Dynamic linker library
- `bionic/linker/` -- The dynamic linker (`/system/bin/linker64`), responsible
  for loading shared libraries and resolving symbols at runtime

The dynamic linker in `bionic/linker/` is particularly important because it
implements the **linker namespace** isolation that enforces the Treble boundary.
Different namespaces (default, sphal, vndk, rs) control which libraries are
visible to which processes, preventing vendor code from accessing unstable
system libraries.

### 1.3.5 Layer 4: Android Runtime (ART)

The Android Runtime (`art/`) executes application bytecode. ART replaced Dalvik
as the default runtime in Android 5.0 (Lollipop).

#### ART Compilation Pipeline

```mermaid
graph LR
    Source["Java/Kotlin<br/>Source Code"] --> Compiler["javac / kotlinc"]
    Compiler --> Bytecode[".class files<br/>(Java bytecode)"]
    Bytecode --> D8["D8/R8<br/>(Dex compiler)"]

        APK --> JIT["JIT Compiler<br/>(Runtime)"]
        JIT --> JITCode["JIT-compiled<br/>code in memory"]
        APK --> Interp["Interpreter<br/>(Fallback)"]
    end

    style Source fill:#fff9c4,stroke:#f9a825
    style DEX fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style Device fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0
```

ART uses a **multi-tier compilation strategy**:

1. **Interpreter**: Executes bytecode instruction-by-instruction. Slowest but
   always available. Used for debugging and for code executed rarely.

2. **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler**: Compiles hot methods to native code at
   runtime. The JIT profiles code execution and saves profile data to disk.

3. **AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) Compiler** (`dex2oat`): Uses JIT profiles to
   pre-compile frequently-used methods to native code during idle time or at
   install time. This is the **Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)** approach
   introduced in Android 7.0.

4. **Cloud Profiles** (Android 9+): Google Play distributes aggregated
   profiles collected from other users. When you install an app, `dex2oat` can
   use the cloud profile to compile the most commonly used methods before you
   even run the app.

The ART source tree in `art/` contains:

- `art/runtime/` -- The runtime itself (GC, class loading, JNI, threading)
- `art/compiler/` -- The JIT and AOT compilers
- `art/dex2oat/` -- The AOT compilation tool
- `art/libartbase/` -- Base utilities
- `art/libdexfile/` -- DEX file parsing
- `art/libnativebridge/` -- Native bridge for running ARM apps on x86 (used by
  Berberis/Houdini translation)
- `art/libnativeloader/` -- Library loading with namespace isolation
- `art/odrefresh/` -- On-device refresh of ART module artifacts
- `art/openjdkjvm/` -- JVM interface implementation
- `art/openjdkjvmti/` -- JVMTI (debug/profiling) interface
- `art/profman/` -- Profile manager for PGO
- `art/imgdiag/` -- Diagnostics for boot image

#### Zygote: The Process Factory

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Init as init
    participant Zygote as Zygote
    participant SS as system_server
    participant AMS as ActivityManagerService
    participant App as Application Process

    Init->>Zygote: Start zygote (app_process)
    Note over Zygote: Preload classes<br/>Preload resources<br/>Initialize ART
    Zygote->>SS: Fork system_server
    Note over SS: Start 100+ system services
    SS->>AMS: Start ActivityManagerService

    Note over AMS: User launches app
    AMS->>Zygote: Request new process<br/>(socket command)
    Zygote->>App: fork()
    Note over App: Specialize:<br/>Set UID/GID<br/>Set SELinux context<br/>Load APK<br/>Call Application.onCreate()
    App->>AMS: attachApplication()
    AMS->>App: Schedule Activity launch
```

**Zygote** (`frameworks/base/cmds/app_process/` and `system/zygote/`) is one of
Android's most important architectural innovations. It is the parent process of
every application process and `system_server`.

When Android boots:

1. The `init` process starts `zygote` (technically, the `app_process64` binary)
2. Zygote initializes the ART runtime
3. Zygote **preloads** thousands of Java classes and resources that all
   applications will need
4. Zygote enters a loop, listening on a Unix domain socket for commands

When a new application process is needed:

1. `ActivityManagerService` sends a command to Zygote's socket
2. Zygote calls `fork()`, creating a child process
3. The child process inherits all preloaded classes and resources via
   **copy-on-write** memory sharing
4. The child specializes: sets its UID, GID, SELinux context, loads the
   application's APK, and begins execution

This fork-based architecture is what makes Android app startup fast. Without
Zygote, each app would need to start a new ART instance from scratch, load and
verify thousands of classes, and parse framework resources -- a process that
would take several seconds. With Zygote, `fork()` takes milliseconds, and the
shared pages mean less physical memory is consumed.

### 1.3.6 Layer 5: Framework Services (system_server)

The `system_server` process is the heart of the Android framework. It is the
first process Zygote forks, and it hosts **over 100 system services** that
collectively manage every aspect of the user experience.

#### system_server Service Catalog

The services in `system_server` are organized in the source tree under
`frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/`. This directory
contains over 100 subdirectories:

exposing its functionality through AIDL-defined interfaces.

#### system_server Startup

When `system_server` starts (forked from Zygote), it initializes services in a
specific order defined in `SystemServer.java`
(`frameworks/base/services/java/com/android/server/SystemServer.java`):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Z as Zygote
    participant SS as SystemServer
    participant SM as ServiceManager

    Z->>SS: fork() + exec
    SS->>SS: startBootstrapServices()
    Note over SS: Installer<br/>DeviceIdentifiersPolicyService<br/>UriGrantsManagerService<br/>ActivityManagerService<br/>PowerManagerService<br/>RecoverySystemService<br/>PackageManagerService<br/>UserManagerService<br/>OverlayManagerService<br/>SensorPrivacyService

    SS->>SS: startCoreServices()
    Note over SS: BatteryService<br/>UsageStatsService<br/>WebViewUpdateService<br/>CachedDeviceStateService<br/>BinderCallsStatsService

    SS->>SS: startOtherServices()
    Note over SS: (80+ services)<br/>WindowManagerService<br/>InputManagerService<br/>AudioService<br/>ConnectivityService<br/>NotificationManagerService<br/>LocationManagerService<br/>... and many more

    SS->>SS: startApexServices()
    Note over SS: Services from Mainline modules

    SS->>SM: Register all services
    Note over SM: Services now discoverable<br/>via Binder
```

Services are started in four phases:

1. **Bootstrap services** -- The absolute minimum needed for the system to
   function (AMS, PMS, PowerManager)
2. **Core services** -- Essential but not bootstrap-critical (Battery, UsageStats)
3. **Other services** -- Everything else (Window, Input, Audio, Connectivity,
   Notification, Location, etc.)
4. **APEX services** -- Services that come from Mainline modules

### 1.3.7 Layer 6: Framework APIs

The Framework API layer (`frameworks/base/core/java/android/`) is what
application developers interact with. It is the public surface of the Android
platform, documented at developer.android.com and versioned by API level.

The `android.*` package hierarchy contains approximately 50 top-level packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `android.app` | Activity, Service, Application, Fragment, Notification, Dialog |
| `android.content` | ContentProvider, ContentResolver, Intent, Context, SharedPreferences |
| `android.view` | View, ViewGroup, Window, MotionEvent, KeyEvent, Surface |
| `android.widget` | TextView, Button, RecyclerView, ImageView, and all standard widgets |
| `android.os` | Binder, Handler, Looper, Bundle, Parcel, Process, SystemClock |
| `android.graphics` | Canvas, Paint, Bitmap, drawable.*, animation.* |
| `android.media` | MediaPlayer, MediaRecorder, AudioTrack, AudioRecord, MediaCodec |
| `android.net` | ConnectivityManager, NetworkInfo, Uri, wifi.* |
| `android.telephony` | TelephonyManager, SmsManager, PhoneStateListener |
| `android.location` | LocationManager, LocationListener, Geocoder |
| `android.hardware` | Camera2 API, SensorManager, usb.*, biometrics.* |
| `android.database` | SQLite wrappers, Cursor, ContentValues |
| `android.provider` | Contacts, MediaStore, Settings, CallLog |
| `android.security` | KeyStore, KeyChain |
| `android.accounts` | AccountManager |
| `android.animation` | ValueAnimator, ObjectAnimator, AnimatorSet |
| `android.transition` | Scene, Transition framework |
| `android.speech` | Speech recognition, text-to-speech |
| `android.print` | Printing framework |
| `android.service` | Abstract base classes for various service types |
| `android.permission` | Permission-related APIs |
| `android.util` | Log, TypedValue, SparseArray, ArrayMap |
| `android.text` | Spannable, TextWatcher, Html, Editable |
| `android.webkit` | WebView, WebSettings, WebChromeClient |

Each of these packages contains classes that are essentially Binder client
proxies. When you call `startActivity()`, the `Activity` class (in
`android.app`) calls through to `ActivityTaskManager`, which calls through
to an `IActivityTaskManager.Stub.Proxy`, which makes a Binder transaction to
`ActivityTaskManagerService` in `system_server`. This pattern -- **client-side
proxy wrapping Binder IPC to a server-side implementation** -- is universal
across the Android framework.

### 1.3.8 Layer 7: Applications

At the top of the stack sit the applications -- both system apps that ship with
the OS and user-installed apps.

#### System Applications in AOSP

AOSP ships with a substantial set of system applications in `packages/apps/`:

| Application | Directory | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **SystemUI** | `frameworks/base/packages/SystemUI/` | Status bar, notification shade, quick settings, lock screen, volume dialog, power menu, recent apps, pip |
| **Launcher3** | `packages/apps/Launcher3/` | Home screen, app drawer, widgets, workspace |
| **Settings** | `packages/apps/Settings/` | System settings application |
| **Contacts** | `packages/apps/Contacts/` | Contact management |
| **Dialer** | `packages/apps/Dialer/` | Phone dialer and call management |
| **Camera2** | `packages/apps/Camera2/` | Camera application |
| **Calendar** | `packages/apps/Calendar/` | Calendar application |
| **Messaging** | `packages/apps/Messaging/` | SMS/MMS messaging |
| **DeskClock** | `packages/apps/DeskClock/` | Clock, alarm, timer, stopwatch |
| **Music** | `packages/apps/Music/` | Basic music player |
| **Gallery2** | `packages/apps/Gallery2/` | Photo gallery |
| **DocumentsUI** | `packages/apps/DocumentsUI/` | File manager (Storage Access Framework UI) |
| **Browser2** | `packages/apps/Browser2/` | WebView-based browser |
| **KeyChain** | `packages/apps/KeyChain/` | Certificate management |
| **CertInstaller** | `packages/apps/CertInstaller/` | Certificate installation |
| **ManagedProvisioning** | `packages/apps/ManagedProvisioning/` | Enterprise device setup (work profile) |
| **Stk** | `packages/apps/Stk/` | SIM Toolkit |
| **StorageManager** | `packages/apps/StorageManager/` | Storage management |
| **ThemePicker** | `packages/apps/ThemePicker/` | Material You theme customization |
| **Traceur** | `packages/apps/Traceur/` | System tracing (developer tool) |
| **WallpaperPicker2** | `packages/apps/WallpaperPicker2/` | Wallpaper selection |
| **TV** | `packages/apps/TV/` | Android TV launcher and EPG |

SystemUI deserves special mention because it is not a typical application -- it
is a system-privileged process that provides the core user interface chrome:
the status bar, the notification shade, the quick settings panel, the lock
screen, the volume dialog, the power menu, the picture-in-picture controls,
the recent apps interface (on some configurations), and more. It runs in its
own process (`com.android.systemui`) with elevated permissions and deep
integration with `WindowManagerService` and other system services.

#### Content Providers

AOSP also ships system content providers in `packages/providers/`:

| Provider | Description |
|---|---|
| `ContactsProvider` | Contacts database (contacts2.db) |
| `MediaProvider` | Media database (images, video, audio) and scoped storage |
| `CalendarProvider` | Calendar events and reminders |
| `TelephonyProvider` | SMS/MMS messages, carrier configuration |
| `DownloadProvider` | System download manager |
| `SettingsProvider` | System, secure, and global settings |
| `BlockedNumberProvider` | Blocked phone numbers |
| `UserDictionaryProvider` | Custom keyboard dictionary |
| `BookmarkProvider` | Browser bookmarks (legacy) |

---

## 1.4 Repository Structure: A Complete Guide

The AOSP source tree is enormous. A full checkout, including prebuilt toolchains
and all default repositories, can exceed 300 GB. Understanding the top-level
directory structure is essential for navigating the codebase efficiently.

The source is managed by `repo`, a tool built on top of Git. The
`.repo/manifest.xml` file defines the complete set of Git repositories and where
they are checked out. A typical AOSP checkout has over 1,000 individual Git
repositories, each mapping to a subdirectory in the source tree.

    test/             -- Extensive test suite (thousands of tests)
    benchmark/        -- Performance benchmarks
    tools/            -- Development utilities
    build/            -- Build configuration
```

**Who cares about this directory:** Runtime engineers, garbage collection
researchers, JIT/AOT compiler developers, anyone debugging class loading or
JNI issues.

#### `bionic/` -- Android's C Library

Bionic is the C library, math library, and dynamic linker for Android.

```
bionic/
    libc/             -- C library implementation
        arch-arm/     --   ARM-specific assembly (memcpy, strcmp, etc.)
        arch-arm64/   --   ARM64-specific assembly
        arch-riscv64/ --   RISC-V 64-bit assembly
        arch-x86/     --   x86-specific assembly
        arch-x86_64/  --   x86_64-specific assembly
        bionic/       --   Core C library sources (pthread, malloc, stdio, etc.)
        dns/          --   DNS resolver
        include/      --   C library headers
        kernel/       --   Kernel header wrappers (auto-generated from kernel)
        malloc_debug/ --   Memory debugging tools
        stdio/        --   Standard I/O implementation
        stdlib/       --   Standard library (qsort, bsearch, etc.)
        string/       --   String operations
        system_properties/ -- Android property system client
        upstream-*    --   Code imported from OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD
    libm/             -- Math library (sin, cos, sqrt, etc.)
    libdl/            -- Dynamic loading library (dlopen, dlsym)
    libstdc++/        -- Minimal C++ standard library (full C++ is libc++)
    linker/           -- Dynamic linker (/system/bin/linker64)
    tests/            -- Test suite
    benchmarks/       -- Performance benchmarks
    tools/            -- Maintenance tools (header generation, symbol checking)
    apex/             -- APEX module configuration
    docs/             -- Documentation
```

**Who cares about this directory:** Native developers working at the C level,
anyone debugging memory issues (malloc_debug), linker/loader problems, or
architecture-specific behavior. The `linker/` subdirectory is essential for
understanding namespace isolation and the Treble vendor boundary.

#### `libcore/` -- Java Core Libraries

The Java standard library implementation for Android.

```
libcore/
    dalvik/           -- Dalvik-specific classes (system, bytecode)
    dom/              -- DOM XML implementation
    harmony-tests/    -- Apache Harmony compatibility tests
    json/             -- org.json (JSON parsing)
    luni/             -- Main library: java.*, javax.*, sun.misc.*
    mmodules/         -- Mainline module boundaries
    ojluni/           -- OpenJDK-derived code (java.util, java.io, etc.)
    xml/              -- XML parsing (SAX, XPath)
```

These provide the `java.lang`, `java.util`, `java.io`, `java.net`, `java.nio`,
`java.security`, `java.sql`, `javax.crypto`, and other standard Java APIs.
Unlike a standard JDK, Android's implementation is heavily modified: it uses
Bionic instead of glibc, `android.icu` instead of some `java.text`
functionality, and has Android-specific security providers.

**Who cares about this directory:** Anyone debugging Java standard library
behavior on Android, or working on the ART Mainline module.

#### `libnativehelper/` -- JNI Helper Library

Utility library that simplifies JNI (Java Native Interface) coding:

```
libnativehelper/
    header_only_include/  -- Header-only JNI helpers
    include/              -- Public headers
    include_jni/          -- JNI specification headers (jni.h)
    tests/                -- Tests
```

Provides `JNIHelp.h` with functions like `jniRegisterNativeMethods()`,
`jniThrowException()`, and `jniCreateString()` that reduce boilerplate in
JNI code throughout the platform.

#### `dalvik/` -- Legacy Dalvik VM (Mostly Historical)

```
dalvik/
    dexgen/           -- DEX file generation utilities
    docs/             -- Historical documentation
    dx/               -- Original dx tool (DEX compiler, replaced by D8)
    opcode-gen/       -- Opcode definition generation
    tools/            -- Utilities
```

The Dalvik VM itself was removed when ART replaced it in Android 5.0. This
directory now contains mostly tools, the legacy `dx` compiler (replaced by D8/R8
in the build system), and opcode definitions used by other tools.

### 1.4.3 Framework

#### `frameworks/` -- The Android Framework

This is the largest and most important directory in AOSP. It contains the entire
Android application framework, native services, system libraries, and system
components.

### 1.4.4 Build System

#### `build/` -- The Build System

AOSP uses a hybrid build system: **Soong** (Blueprint-based, written in Go) is
the primary build system, with legacy **Make** support for components not yet
converted.

```
build/
    soong/            -- Soong build system (Go source)
        android/      --   Android module types
        cc/           --   C/C++ build rules
        java/         --   Java build rules
        apex/         --   APEX package build rules
        rust/         --   Rust build rules
        python/       --   Python build rules
        genrule/      --   Generic build rules
        ...
    make/             -- Legacy Make-based build system
        core/         --   Core Makefile logic
        target/       --   Target configuration
        tools/        --   Build tools (releasetools, zipalign, etc.)
        envsetup.sh   --   Environment setup (lunch, m, mm, mmm commands)
    blueprint/        -- Blueprint build file parser (Soong's frontend)
    pesto/            -- Build analysis tools
    release/          -- Release configuration
    target/           -- Target (device) build configuration
    tools/            -- Build utilities
```

Build files in AOSP are named:

- `Android.bp` -- Soong (Blueprint) build files (preferred)
- `Android.mk` -- Legacy Make build files (being migrated to .bp)
- `Makefile` -- Rare, for special cases

**Who cares about this directory:** Everyone who builds AOSP. The build system
is the first thing you interact with and the last thing you debug when builds
break.

#### `toolchain/` -- Compiler Toolchain Configuration

```
toolchain/
    pgo-profiles/     -- Profile-Guided Optimization profiles for the toolchain
```

The actual compiler binaries (Clang/LLVM, Rust) are in `prebuilts/`. This
directory contains toolchain configuration and PGO profiles used to optimize
the compiler's output.

#### `prebuilts/` -- Prebuilt Binaries

The largest directory in the AOSP tree by raw size. Contains prebuilt
compiler toolchains, SDKs, and other tools that are not built from source
during a normal AOSP build.

```
prebuilts/
    clang/             -- Clang/LLVM compiler (multiple versions)
    gcc/               -- Legacy GCC compiler (for kernel, being phased out)
    go/                -- Go compiler (for Soong build system)
    jdk/               -- Java Development Kit
    build-tools/       -- aapt2, zipalign, d8, etc.
    gradle-plugin/     -- Android Gradle Plugin
    maven_repo/        -- Maven repository (AndroidX, etc.)
    sdk/               -- Android SDK platforms
    android-emulator/  -- Emulator binaries
    clang-tools/       -- Clang-based analysis tools
    cmake/             -- CMake (for NDK builds)
    cmdline-tools/     -- Android SDK command-line tools
    ktlint/            -- Kotlin linter
    manifest-merger/   -- Manifest merger tool
    bazel/             -- Bazel build tool (experimental)
    devtools/          -- Development tools
    ...
```

**Who cares about this directory:** Build engineers updating toolchains, anyone
debugging compiler issues, developers setting up the build environment.

### 1.4.5 Platform and Hardware

#### `system/` -- Core System Components

Low-level system components that sit between the kernel and the framework.

```
system/
    core/                 -- Core system utilities
        init/             --   init process (PID 1, first userspace process)
        rootdir/          --   Root filesystem init.rc files
        fastboot/         --   Fastboot protocol implementation
        adb/              --   Android Debug Bridge daemon (in Mainline now)
        debuggerd/        --   Crash handler (generates tombstones)
        libcutils/        --   C utility library (properties, threads, etc.)
        libutils/         --   C++ utility library (RefBase, String, Vector)

**Who cares about this directory:** System engineers, security researchers
(sepolicy), boot engineers (init, fs_mgr), storage engineers (vold), network
engineers (netd), anyone debugging system daemons.

#### `hardware/` -- Hardware Abstraction

```

```

**Who cares about this directory:** HAL implementors, SoC vendors, device
bring-up engineers, driver developers.

#### `device/` -- Device Configurations

Each supported device has a configuration directory here:

```
device/
    generic/          -- Generic device configurations
        goldfish/     --   Emulator (QEMU-based)
        car/          --   Android Automotive emulator
        tv/           --   Android TV emulator
        common/       --   Common configuration shared across generics
    google/           -- Google devices (Pixel)
    google_car/       -- Google Automotive
    amlogic/          -- Amlogic SoC devices
    linaro/           -- Linaro reference boards
    sample/           -- Sample device configuration (template)
```

A device configuration directory typically contains:

- `BoardConfig.mk` -- Board-level configuration (partition sizes, kernel
  config, architecture)
- `device.mk` -- Device-level configuration (which packages to include)
- `AndroidProducts.mk` -- Product definitions (lunch targets)
- `<product>.mk` -- Product-specific configuration
- `overlay/` -- Runtime resource overlays (customizing framework resources)
- `sepolicy/` -- Device-specific SELinux policy
- `init.*.rc` -- Device-specific init scripts
- Kernel configuration fragments

When you run `lunch` to select a build target, you are selecting a product
defined in one of these device directories.

#### `kernel/` -- Kernel Configuration and Prebuilts

```
kernel/
    configs/          -- GKI kernel configuration fragments
    prebuilts/        -- Prebuilt kernel images
    tests/            -- Kernel test suites
```

As mentioned earlier, the full kernel source is typically in a separate
repository. This directory contains configuration fragments, prebuilt images
for development, and test infrastructure.

#### `bootable/` -- Boot and Recovery

```
bootable/
    recovery/         -- Recovery mode implementation
    deprecated-ota/   -- Legacy OTA update tools
    libbootloader/    -- Bootloader libraries
```

The recovery system handles OTA updates (applying update packages),
factory reset, and sideloading. Modern devices use `update_engine`
(`system/update_engine/`) for A/B seamless updates, but recovery remains
for non-A/B devices and for factory reset.

#### `trusty/` -- Trusted Execution Environment

```
trusty/
    device/           -- TEE device configurations
    hardware/         -- TEE hardware abstraction
    host/             -- Host-side tools
    kernel/           -- Trusty kernel (separate OS)
    user/             -- Trusty userspace applications
    vendor/           -- Vendor TEE components
```

Trusty is Google's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) operating system. It
runs alongside Android on the same processor, in a separate secure world
(typically using ARM TrustZone). Trusty hosts security-sensitive operations
like key storage (Keymaster), biometric template storage, and DRM key
handling. Not all devices use Trusty -- some use Qualcomm's QSEE or other
TEE implementations -- but it is the reference TEE in AOSP.

### 1.4.6 Testing and Development

#### `cts/` -- Compatibility Test Suite

```
cts/
    tests/            -- CTS test cases (organized by API area)
    hostsidetests/    -- Tests that run on the host (controlling the device)
    apps/             -- Test helper applications
    libs/             -- Test libraries
    common/           -- Common test utilities
    helpers/          -- Test helper utilities
    suite/            -- Test suite configuration
```

CTS is one of the pillars of the Android ecosystem. To ship a device with
Google Play (GMS), OEMs must pass CTS -- a suite of hundreds of thousands of
tests that verify API compatibility. CTS ensures that an app written against
the Android SDK will work the same way on a Samsung Galaxy as on a Google Pixel.

CTS tests cover:

- API behavior (does `Context.getSystemService()` return the correct service?)
- Permission enforcement (does a non-privileged app get SecurityException when
  expected?)
- Media codecs (does the device support required codecs at required quality?)
- Graphics (does OpenGL ES / Vulkan behave correctly?)
- Security (is SELinux enforcing? Are file permissions correct?)
- Performance (does the device meet minimum benchmarks?)
- And thousands more test cases

#### `test/` -- Test Infrastructure

```
test/
    vts/              -- Vendor Test Suite (tests HAL implementations)
    mlts/             -- Machine Learning Test Suite
    catbox/           -- Test suite for automotive
    mts/              -- Mainline Test Suite
    ...
```

VTS (Vendor Test Suite) is the companion to CTS for the vendor partition. It
tests HAL implementations to ensure they conform to the HIDL/AIDL interface
specifications.

#### `platform_testing/` -- Platform-Level Testing

```
platform_testing/
    tests/            -- Platform integration tests
    libraries/        -- Test utility libraries
    build/            -- Test build configuration
```

Platform-level tests that go beyond CTS, testing internal platform behavior
that is not part of the public API contract.

#### `development/` -- Development Utilities

```
development/
    apps/             -- Sample applications
    samples/          -- SDK samples
    tools/            -- Development tools
    ide/              -- IDE configuration
    scripts/          -- Helper scripts
    vndk/             -- VNDK tools
    ...
```

Contains sample code, development tools, and IDE configurations. The samples
here are different from the SDK samples -- they often demonstrate system-level
features.

#### `developers/` -- Developer Documentation and Samples

```
developers/
    build/            -- Build configuration for samples
    samples/          -- Developer-facing code samples
```

Additional developer-facing samples and documentation support.

#### `tools/` -- Development and Analysis Tools

```
tools/
    metalava/         -- API signature extraction and checking tool
    tradefederation/  -- Trade Federation (test harness framework)
    apksig/           -- APK signing library
    apkzlib/          -- APK ZIP library
    treble/           -- Treble compliance tools
    acloud/           -- Cloud-based Android Virtual Devices
    asuite/           -- Test suite management (atest, etc.)
    security/         -- Security analysis tools
    dexter/           -- DEX analysis tool
    repohooks/        -- Repo pre-upload hooks
    netsim/           -- Network simulation
    rootcanal/        -- Bluetooth emulation
    external_updater/ -- Tool for updating external/ projects
    carrier_settings/ -- Carrier configuration tools
    lint_checks/      -- Custom lint checks
    ...
```

**Metalava** deserves special mention: it is the tool that extracts the Android
API signature from source code, compares it against previous versions, and
enforces API compatibility rules (no removing public APIs, no changing method
signatures, etc.). The API surface files it generates (`current.txt`,
`removed.txt`, `system-current.txt`) are the canonical definition of the
Android API.

**Trade Federation (TradeFed)** is the test harness used to run CTS, VTS, and
other test suites. It handles device management, test execution, result
collection, and reporting.

#### `sdk/` -- SDK Build Support

```
sdk/
    build_tools/      -- SDK build tools configuration
    emulator/         -- Emulator configuration
    ...
```

Support files for building the Android SDK that is distributed to application
developers via Android Studio.

#### `pdk/` -- Platform Development Kit

```
pdk/
    build/            -- PDK build support
    ...
```

The Platform Development Kit helps OEMs and SoC vendors start their
customization work before a new Android version is publicly released. Google
shares the PDK with partners under NDA, allowing them to begin porting work
early.

### 1.4.7 External Libraries

#### `external/` -- Third-Party Libraries

With over **467 subdirectories**, `external/` is one of the widest directories
in AOSP. It contains third-party open-source libraries used throughout the
platform:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Compression** | zlib, zstd, brotli, lz4, xz |
| **Cryptography** | boringssl (OpenSSL fork by Google), conscrypt |
| **Database** | sqlite |
| **Graphics** | skia (2D rendering engine), vulkan-*, angle, mesa3d |
| **Media** | libvpx, libaom, opus, flac, tremolo, libmpeg2 |
| **Networking** | curl, okhttp, grpc, protobuf |
| **Fonts** | noto-fonts, roboto-fonts |
| **Text/Unicode** | icu, harfbuzz_ng, libxml2, expat |
| **Languages** | kotlin-*, python3, lua |
| **Testing** | googletest, junit, mockito, robolectric |
| **ML/AI** | tensorflow-lite, XNNPACK, flatbuffers |
| **Build** | cmake, ninja, gyp |
| **Debugging** | lldb, valgrind, strace, elfutils |
| **Security** | selinux, pcre, libcap |
| **Bluetooth** | aac (for A2DP), libldac |
| **Automotive** | android_onboarding |
| **Misc** | libjpeg-turbo, libpng, giflib, webp, freetype |

Each subdirectory in `external/` has its own upstream project, license, and
update cadence. The `tools/external_updater/` tool helps maintain these
dependencies by tracking upstream versions and automating updates.

**Who cares about this directory:** Anyone debugging a third-party library
behavior, updating an external dependency, or auditing licenses.

### 1.4.8 Output

#### `out/` -- Build Output

```
out/
    target/                       -- Device build artifacts
        product/<device>/
            system/               --   System partition image contents
            vendor/               --   Vendor partition image contents
            system.img            --   System image
            vendor.img            --   Vendor image
            boot.img              --   Boot image (kernel + ramdisk)
            recovery.img          --   Recovery image
            super.img             --   Super image (dynamic partitions)
    host/                         -- Host tool build artifacts
    soong/                        -- Soong intermediate files
        .intermediates/           --   Build intermediates (MASSIVE)
    .module_paths/                -- Module path cache
```

The `out/` directory is not checked into version control. It is where all build
artifacts are generated. A full build can produce 100+ GB of intermediate and
final artifacts. The `out/target/product/<device>/` directory contains the
flashable images.

### 1.4.9 Source Tree Size Perspective

To give a sense of scale:

```mermaid
pie title AOSP Source Tree - Approximate Size Distribution
    "prebuilts/ (toolchains, SDKs)" : 45
    "external/ (third-party libs)" : 20
    "frameworks/ (Android framework)" : 12
    "out/ (build output)" : 10
    "cts/ + test/ (testing)" : 5
    "art/ + bionic/ (runtime)" : 3
    "system/ (core system)" : 2
    "Everything else" : 3
```

The vast majority of the source tree's disk consumption comes from prebuilt
binaries (compilers, SDKs, emulator images) and external third-party libraries.
The actual Android-specific code -- the framework, runtime, system components,
and build system -- is a much smaller fraction of the total disk usage, though
it is still enormous in its own right (tens of millions of lines of code).

## 1.5 Who Maintains What

The Android ecosystem is a collaboration between Google, silicon vendors, OEMs,
and the open-source community. Understanding who is responsible for which parts
of the stack is essential for knowing where to file bugs, where to send patches,
and whose constraints shape the architecture.

### 1.5.2 Google's Role

Google is the primary maintainer of AOSP. Google engineers write the majority
of framework code, runtime improvements, build system changes, and test
infrastructure. Google's specific responsibilities include:

**Framework Development:**

- All system services in `system_server` (AMS, WMS, PMS, and 100+ others)
- The Android API surface (`frameworks/base/core/`)
- Native services (SurfaceFlinger, AudioFlinger, InputFlinger)
- Media framework (`frameworks/av/`)
- The build system (Soong, Blueprint, Make)

**API Governance:**

- API design review (every new public API goes through an API council)
- API compatibility enforcement (via Metalava and CTS)
- API level management (each Android release increments the API level)
- Deprecation policy (APIs are deprecated but rarely removed)

**Compatibility:**

- CTS development and maintenance
- CDD (Compatibility Definition Document) authorship
- VTS (Vendor Test Suite) for HAL compliance
- GTS (Google Test Suite, proprietary) for GMS compliance
- Treble / VNDK stability requirements

**Mainline Modules:**

- Google develops and maintains Mainline modules that can be updated via the
  Play Store independently of full OS updates. As of Android 15, over 30
  modules are "mainlined," including:
  - Connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth, Tethering, DNS)
  - Media (codecs, extractors)
  - Permissions
  - ART (the runtime itself!)
  - ADB
  - Scheduling
  - Neural Networks (NNAPI)
  - And more

**Reference Hardware:**

- Pixel devices serve as the reference implementation
- The Android Emulator (Goldfish/Cuttlefish) provides a software reference
- Google Tensor chips allow Google to optimize the full stack

**Security:**

- Monthly security bulletins and patches
- SELinux policy development
- Verified boot implementation
- Keystore/Keymaster/StrongBox specifications

### 1.5.3 SoC Vendor Responsibilities

Silicon vendors (Qualcomm, MediaTek, Samsung LSI, Google Tensor, Unisoc, and
others) provide the lowest layers of the software stack:

**Kernel Board Support Package (BSP):**

- Device tree definitions for the SoC
- Driver implementations for all on-chip peripherals
- Power management (DVFS, idle states)
- Thermal management
- Kernel scheduler tuning

**HAL Implementations:**

| HAL | What SoC Vendors Provide |
|---|---|
| **Camera** | ISP drivers, 3A algorithms (auto-focus, auto-exposure, auto-white-balance), HDR processing, multi-camera synchronization |
| **Graphics** | GPU kernel driver, userspace GL/Vulkan libraries, HWC (Hardware Composer) for display composition |
| **Audio** | ALSA/audio kernel driver, audio DSP firmware and control, codec configuration |
| **Sensors** | Sensor hub firmware, sensor HAL implementation |
| **Modem / Telephony** | RIL (Radio Interface Layer) implementation, modem firmware, IMS (VoLTE/VoWiFi) |
| **Video Codec** | Hardware codec drivers, Codec2 HAL implementation |
| **AI/ML** | NPU/DSP drivers, NNAPI HAL implementation |
| **WiFi** | WiFi driver, WiFi HAL implementation, firmware |
| **Bluetooth** | BT controller driver, BT HAL implementation, firmware |
| **GNSS** | GNSS driver, location HAL implementation |

SoC vendors typically deliver their BSP as a large set of proprietary source
code and prebuilt binaries. OEMs receive this BSP and integrate it with their
device configuration.

The Treble architecture means that SoC vendors can deliver HAL implementations
once, and OEMs can update the Android framework independently. In practice,
major OS upgrades still require BSP updates from the SoC vendor, but minor
updates and security patches can be applied without vendor involvement.

### 1.5.4 OEM Responsibilities

OEMs (Samsung, Xiaomi, OPPO, OnePlus, Motorola, Sony, Google itself, and many
others) are responsible for the final consumer product. Their work spans:

**Device Bring-up:**

- Board-specific configuration (device tree, partition layout)
- Device-specific init scripts
- SELinux policy customization
- Kernel configuration (enabling/disabling features)

**User Experience Customization:**

- SystemUI modifications (status bar, quick settings, lock screen)
- Custom launcher (Samsung One UI Home, Xiaomi Poco Launcher, etc.)
- Settings app customization (adding OEM-specific settings pages)
- Theming and visual design (icons, colors, animations, fonts)
- Sounds (ringtones, notification sounds, UI sounds)
- Boot animation

**Feature Development:**

- Multi-window enhancements (Samsung DeX, foldable split-screen)
- Pen/stylus support (Samsung S Pen, Motorola Smart Stylus)
- Camera software (computational photography, filters, modes)
- Security additions (Samsung Knox, Xiaomi Mi Security)
- Accessibility features
- Regional customizations (dual SIM behavior, local payment integration)

**Testing and Certification:**

- Running CTS to achieve Android compatibility certification
- Running GTS for GMS certification
- Carrier certification testing
- Regional regulatory testing (FCC, CE, etc.)

**Updates:**

- Porting new Android versions to existing devices
- Monthly security patch integration
- Mainline module updates (via Play Store)
- Firmware updates (modem, TrustZone, bootloader)

### 1.5.5 Community Contributions

The open-source community plays several roles:

**Custom ROM Development:**
Custom ROMs take AOSP and build alternative distributions. Major projects:

| Project | Focus |
|---|---|
| **LineageOS** | Successor to CyanogenMod. Broad device support, close to AOSP with useful additions. The largest custom ROM community. |
| **GrapheneOS** | Security and privacy focused. Hardened memory allocator, improved sandboxing, no Google dependencies by default. Pixel-only. |
| **CalyxOS** | Privacy focused with optional microG (open-source Play Services replacement). Pixel and a few other devices. |
| **/e/OS** | De-Googled Android with cloud services. Targeted at mainstream users who want privacy without complexity. |
| **Paranoid Android** | UI innovation and design focus. Known for introducing features later adopted by AOSP (immersive mode, heads-up notifications). |
| **crDroid** | Feature-rich, combining customizations from multiple sources. |

**Bug Reports and Code Review:**
The AOSP Gerrit instance (android-review.googlesource.com) accepts external
contributions, though the process is more restrictive than typical open-source
projects. Community members also file bugs on the AOSP issue tracker
(issuetracker.google.com) and participate in mailing lists.

**Custom Kernels:**
Independent kernel developers build optimized kernels for specific devices,
often incorporating upstream Linux improvements, scheduler tweaks, and
performance optimizations ahead of the official release cycle.

**Xposed / Magisk:**
The modding community uses frameworks like Xposed (runtime Java method hooking)
and Magisk (systemless root) to modify Android behavior without changing the
system partition. These tools demonstrate deep understanding of ART internals,
the init system, and dm-verity.

### 1.6.3 API Level Growth

The number of public APIs in the Android SDK has grown enormously:

| Version | Approx. Public API Count | Notable Additions |
|---|---|---|
| API 1 (1.0) | ~2,000 | Foundation: Activity, View, Intent, ContentProvider |
| API 8 (2.2) | ~5,000 | Backup, Cloud-to-Device Messaging |
| API 14 (4.0) | ~10,000 | ActionBar, Fragments (phones), Social APIs |
| API 21 (5.0) | ~18,000 | Material Design, Camera2, JobScheduler, ART |

| API 35 (15) | ~40,000+ | Satellite APIs, Private space, Health Connect |

Each API level is a strict superset of the previous (with rare deprecation
removals). The API is defined by signature files maintained by Metalava:

- `current.txt` -- Public API signature
- `system-current.txt` -- System API (for privileged apps)
- `module-lib-current.txt` -- Module library API (for Mainline modules)
- `test-current.txt` -- Test API

## 1.7 The Developer's Journey: Roadmap of This Book

Working with AOSP is a journey that begins with downloading the source and
progressively deepens into understanding, modifying, building, testing, and
contributing to the platform. This section outlines the typical developer
journey and maps it to the chapters of this book.

```

### 1.7.2 Phase 1: Getting the Source and Building

The first step is to download the AOSP source code and build it. This is
covered in **Chapter 2: Setting Up the Development Environment**.

```
# Install repo tool
mkdir -p ~/bin
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

# Initialize the AOSP repository
mkdir aosp && cd aosp
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b main

# Sync all repositories (this downloads ~100 GB)
repo sync -c -j$(nproc) --optimized-fetch

# Set up the build environment
source build/envsetup.sh

# Choose a build target
lunch aosp_cf_x86_64_phone-trunk_staging-eng

# Build
m -j$(nproc)
```

The `lunch` command selects a **product** (device configuration), a **release**,
and a **variant** (eng, userdebug, or user):

| Variant | Description | Debugging | Performance |
|---|---|---|---|
| `eng` | Engineering build. Full debugging, all development tools. | Full: adb root, all logs, debug assertions | Lower (debug overhead) |
| `userdebug` | Production-like with debugging. **Recommended for development.** | adb root, debug logs available | Near-production |
| `user` | Production build. What ships to consumers. | No adb root, limited logs | Full production |

After building, you can launch the emulator:

```
# Launch Cuttlefish (cloud/headless emulator)
launch_cvd

# Or launch the graphical emulator
emulator
```

### 1.7.3 Phase 2: Understanding the Architecture

With the source downloaded and a running build, the next step is understanding
how the pieces fit together. This is the focus of the early chapters:

- **Chapter 1 (this chapter)**: The big picture -- architecture, source tree,
  stakeholders
- **Chapter 2**: Build environment, repo, Soong/Blueprint, build targets
- **Chapter 3**: The build system in depth -- how `Android.bp` files work, module
  types, build variants
- **Chapter 4**: The boot process -- from bootloader to lock screen
- **Chapter 5**: Binder IPC -- the backbone of all inter-process communication
- **Chapter 6**: system_server and framework services -- the heart of Android

### 1.7.4 Phase 3: Exploration and Debugging

Once you understand the architecture, you can explore the live system:

- **Chapter 7**: Debugging tools -- logcat, dumpsys, Perfetto, LLDB, Android
  Studio platform debugging
- **Chapter 8**: ART internals -- garbage collection, JIT/AOT, class loading
- **Chapter 9**: Graphics pipeline -- SurfaceFlinger, HWUI, BufferQueue, HWC
- **Chapter 10**: Input pipeline -- from touchscreen driver to app's
  `onTouchEvent()`
- **Chapter 11**: Activity and window management -- AMS, WMS, task stacks

### 1.7.5 Phase 4: Modification and Development

With understanding comes the ability to modify:

- **Chapter 12**: Modifying framework services -- adding a new system service
- **Chapter 13**: HAL development -- implementing a hardware abstraction layer
- **Chapter 14**: System app development -- customizing SystemUI, Launcher,
  Settings
- **Chapter 15**: Device bring-up -- adding support for new hardware
- **Chapter 16**: Mainline modules -- developing updatable components

### 1.7.6 Phase 5: Advanced Topics and Mastery

- **Chapter 17**: Performance optimization -- profiling, tracing, benchmarking
- **Chapter 18**: Security architecture -- SELinux, Keystore, verified boot,
  sandboxing
- **Chapter 19**: Testing -- CTS, VTS, writing platform tests
- **Chapter 20**: Contributing to AOSP -- Gerrit workflow, code review process

### 1.7.7 Tracing an API Call End-to-End

To give a concrete sense of what "understanding the architecture" means in
practice, let us trace what happens when an application calls
`startActivity(intent)`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application (App Process)
    participant Binder as Binder (Kernel Driver)
    participant ATMS as ActivityTaskManagerService (system_server)
    participant AMS as ActivityManagerService (system_server)
    participant WMS as WindowManagerService (system_server)
    participant Zygote as Zygote
    participant Target as Target Application (New Process)
    participant SF as SurfaceFlinger

    App->>App: startActivity(intent)
    App->>App: Instrumentation<br/>.execStartActivity()
    App->>Binder: IActivityTaskManager<br/>.startActivity()
    Binder->>ATMS: onTransact()

    Note over ATMS: Resolve intent<br/>(query PackageManager)
    Note over ATMS: Check permissions
    Note over ATMS: Find or create Task

    ATMS->>ATMS: Pause current activity

    alt Target process not running
        ATMS->>AMS: startProcessLocked()
        AMS->>Zygote: Fork request<br/>(via socket)
        Zygote->>Target: fork() + specialize
        Target->>AMS: attachApplication()
    end

    ATMS->>Target: scheduleLaunchActivity()
    Target->>Target: handleLaunchActivity()
    Target->>Target: Activity.onCreate()
    Target->>Target: Activity.onStart()
    Target->>Target: Activity.onResume()

    Target->>WMS: addWindow()
    WMS->>SF: createLayer()
    Target->>SF: Dequeue buffer<br/>(via BufferQueue)
    Target->>Target: Draw content<br/>(HWUI / Skia)
    Target->>SF: Queue buffer

    SF->>SF: Composite all layers
    SF->>SF: Submit frame<br/>to display
```

This single API call traverses:

1. **Application process** (Java) -- `Activity.startActivity()`
2. **Binder IPC** (kernel driver) -- Cross-process transaction
3. **system_server** (Java) -- `ActivityTaskManagerService` resolves the intent,
   checks permissions, manages the task/activity stack
4. **Zygote** (native) -- Forks a new process if needed
5. **Target application process** (Java) -- Activity lifecycle callbacks
6. **WindowManagerService** (Java) -- Window creation and layout
7. **SurfaceFlinger** (native C++) -- Display composition
8. **Display HAL** (vendor) -- Hardware composition and display output

A single call to `startActivity()` touches virtually every layer of the Android
stack. This is why understanding the full architecture is so valuable -- when
something goes wrong (a slow launch, a permission denial, a display glitch), you
need to know which layer to investigate.

## 1.8 Key Concepts Quick Reference

This section provides brief definitions of the most important concepts you will
encounter throughout this book and throughout AOSP development. Each concept is
explored in depth in later chapters; this serves as a quick reference and
orientation.

### 1.8.1 Binder

**Binder** is Android's inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism. It is the
single most important architectural element in Android -- virtually all
communication between processes goes through Binder.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Client_Process["Client Process"]
        Proxy["AIDL Proxy<br/>(auto-generated)"]
    end

    subgraph Kernel["Kernel"]
        BinderDriver["/dev/binder<br/>(Binder Driver)"]
    end

    subgraph Server_Process["Server Process"]
        Stub["AIDL Stub<br/>(auto-generated)"]
        Impl["Service<br/>Implementation"]
    end

    Proxy -->|"transact()"| BinderDriver
    BinderDriver -->|"onTransact()"| Stub
    Stub --> Impl

    style Client_Process fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0
    style Kernel fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c62828
    style Server_Process fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
```

**Key characteristics:**

- **Transaction-based**: Clients send a data parcel, receive a reply parcel
- **Synchronous by default**: Caller blocks until the server processes the
  request and returns
- **Object-oriented**: Binder references are passed as object handles across
  processes
- **Kernel-mediated**: The kernel driver handles data copying, UID/PID
  verification, and reference counting
- **Three instances**: `/dev/binder` (framework IPC), `/dev/hwbinder`
  (framework-to-HAL), `/dev/vndbinder` (vendor-to-vendor)

**Source locations:**

- Kernel driver: `drivers/android/binder.c` (in kernel source)
- Native library: `frameworks/native/libs/binder/`
- Java layer: `frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/Binder.java`
- AIDL compiler: `system/tools/aidl/`
- ServiceManager: `frameworks/native/cmds/servicemanager/`

Binder is covered in depth in **Chapter 5**.

### 1.8.2 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

The **Hardware Abstraction Layer** is a standardized interface between Android's
framework and hardware-specific vendor implementations. It allows the same
Android framework to run on different hardware platforms.

```mermaid
graph TB
    FW["Framework Service<br/>(e.g., SensorService)"]
    HAL_IF["HAL Interface<br/>(e.g., ISensors.aidl)"]
    HAL_IMPL["HAL Implementation<br/>(vendor-specific)"]
    Driver["Kernel Driver"]

    FW --> HAL_IF
    HAL_IF --> HAL_IMPL
    HAL_IMPL --> Driver

    style FW fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style HAL_IF fill:#fff9c4,stroke:#f9a825
    style HAL_IMPL fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2
    style Driver fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c62828
```

**Key characteristics:**

- Defined by AIDL (modern) or HIDL (legacy) interfaces
- Implemented by SoC vendors and OEMs
- Run in separate processes (out-of-process HALs) for stability and security
- Tested by VTS (Vendor Test Suite)
- Versioned for backward compatibility

**Source location:** `hardware/interfaces/` (interface definitions)

HAL development is covered in **Chapter 13**.

### 1.8.3 AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language)

**AIDL** is a language for defining interfaces that can be used for Binder IPC.
The AIDL compiler generates client-side proxy and server-side stub code in
Java, C++, NDK C++, or Rust.

```
// Example: IActivityManager.aidl
interface IActivityManager {
    int startActivity(in IApplicationThread caller,
                      in String callingPackage,
                      in Intent intent,
                      in String resolvedType,
                      in IBinder resultTo,
                      in String resultWho,
                      int requestCode,
                      int startFlags,
                      in ProfilerInfo profilerInfo,
                      in Bundle bOptions);
    // ... many more methods
}
```

**Key characteristics:**

- Used for both framework IPC and HAL interfaces (Stable AIDL)
- Supports parcelable data types (custom data structures)
- Generates code for Java, C++ (libbinder), NDK C++ (libbinder_ndk), and Rust
- Stable AIDL interfaces are versioned and backward-compatible
- Replaces HIDL for new HAL interfaces (Android 11+)

**Source locations:**

- AIDL compiler: `system/tools/aidl/`
- Framework AIDL files: Throughout `frameworks/base/core/java/`
- HAL AIDL files: `hardware/interfaces/`

### 1.8.4 HIDL (Hardware Interface Definition Language)

**HIDL** was introduced with Project Treble (Android 8.0) as the HAL interface
definition language. It has been superseded by Stable AIDL for new interfaces
but remains in use for existing HALs.

```
// Example: ICameraDevice.hal (HIDL)
interface ICameraDevice {
    getCameraCharacteristics()
        generates (Status status, CameraMetadata cameraCharacteristics);
    open(ICameraDeviceCallback callback)
        generates (Status status, ICameraDeviceSession session);
    // ...
};
```

**Key characteristics:**

- Uses `hwbinder` transport (separate from framework binder)
- Strictly versioned (e.g., `android.hardware.camera.device@3.5`)
- Supports both binderized (cross-process) and passthrough (in-process) modes
- Frozen: no new HIDL interfaces are accepted
- Existing HIDL interfaces will be maintained until migrated to AIDL

**Source locations:**

- HIDL compiler: `system/tools/hidl/`
- HAL HIDL files: `hardware/interfaces/` (`.hal` files)
- Runtime: `system/libhidl/`

### 1.8.5 APEX (Android Pony EXpress)

**APEX** is the packaging format for Mainline modules -- components of Android
that can be updated independently of a full OS update, delivered via the Google
Play Store.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph APEX_Package["APEX Package (.apex)"]
        Manifest["apex_manifest.json"]
        Payload["Payload Image<br/>(ext4 filesystem)"]
        PubKey["Public Key"]
    end

    subgraph Contents["Payload Contents"]
        Libs["Shared Libraries"]
        Bins["Binaries"]
        Jars["Java Libraries"]
        FW_Res["Framework Resources"]
    end

    Payload --> Contents

    subgraph Boot["At Boot"]
        APEXd["apexd daemon"]
        Mount["Mount at<br/>/apex/{name}/"]
    end

    APEXd --> APEX_Package
    APEX_Package --> Mount

    style APEX_Package fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0
    style Contents fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style Boot fill:#fff9c4,stroke:#f9a825
```

**Key characteristics:**

- Self-contained package with its own filesystem image
- Mounted at `/apex/<name>/` at boot
- Cryptographically signed and verified
- Supports rollback (if a new version causes issues)
- Updated via the Play Store (does not require a full OTA)
- Managed by `apexd` (`system/apex/apexd/`)
- Examples: ART, Conscrypt, Media, DNS Resolver, WiFi, Tethering

**Source location:** `system/apex/` (infrastructure), `packages/modules/`
(individual modules)

### 1.8.6 Mainline

**Project Mainline** (introduced in Android 10) is the initiative to modularize
Android so that core components can be updated independently via the Play Store.
Each Mainline module is delivered as an APEX or an updated APK.

    end

    style Traditional fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c62828
    style Mainline_Model fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
```

As of Android 15, Mainline modules include:

| Module | Type | What It Updates |
|---|---|---|
| **ART** | APEX | The runtime itself (GC, JIT, AOT, core libs) |
| **Conscrypt** | APEX | TLS/SSL (certificate handling, crypto) |
| **DNS Resolver** | APEX | DNS resolution |
| **Media** | APEX | Media codecs, extractors, framework |
| **WiFi** | APEX | WiFi stack |
| **Tethering** | APEX | Hotspot and tethering |
| **Bluetooth** | APEX | Bluetooth stack |
| **Connectivity** | APEX | Network connectivity |
| **Telephony** | APEX | Telephony framework |
| **Permission Controller** | APK | Permission UI |
| **Neural Networks** | APEX | NNAPI runtime |
| **StatsD** | APEX | Metrics collection |
| **IPsec** | APEX | VPN |
| **SDK Extensions** | APEX | API extension mechanism |
| **AdServices** | APEX | Privacy-preserving advertising |
| **UWB** | APEX | Ultra-Wideband |
| **ADB** | APEX | Android Debug Bridge |
| **Health Connect** | APK | Health and fitness data |
| **Scheduling** | APEX | Task scheduling |
| **Profiling** | APEX | Performance profiling |
| **On-Device Personalization** | APEX | ML personalization |

The significance of Mainline cannot be overstated. Before Mainline, a security
vulnerability in the DNS resolver or the media framework required a full OS
update that had to go through the entire OEM/carrier update pipeline. With
Mainline, Google can push a fix to billions of devices within weeks, regardless
of whether the OEM has issued an OS update.

### 1.8.7 ART (Android Runtime)

**ART** is the managed runtime that executes application and framework code on
Android. It replaced Dalvik in Android 5.0.

**Key characteristics:**

- Executes DEX bytecode (Dalvik Executable format)
- Multi-tier execution: interpreter, JIT compiler, AOT compiler (`dex2oat`)
- Profile-Guided Optimization: JIT profiles guide AOT compilation
- Concurrent, generational garbage collector (CC: Concurrent Copying)
- Supports 32-bit and 64-bit architectures (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86_64, RISC-V)
- Itself is a Mainline module (updatable via Play Store)

**Source location:** `art/`

ART internals are covered in **Chapter 8**.

### 1.8.8 Zygote

**Zygote** is the parent process from which all Android application processes
and `system_server` are forked.

**Key characteristics:**

- Started by `init` early in boot
- Preloads common classes (~6,000+) and resources
- Listens on a Unix domain socket for fork requests
- Uses `fork()` for fast process creation via copy-on-write
- Two instances on 64-bit: `zygote64` (primary) and `zygote` (32-bit for
  legacy apps)

**Source locations:**

- Entry point: `frameworks/base/cmds/app_process/`
- Java: `frameworks/base/core/java/com/android/internal/os/ZygoteInit.java`
- Configuration: `system/zygote/`

### 1.8.9 system_server

**system_server** is the process that hosts all Java-based framework services.
It is the first process Zygote forks during boot.

**Key characteristics:**

- Hosts 100+ system services (AMS, WMS, PMS, and many more)
- Services communicate with apps via Binder IPC
- Runs as the `system` user (UID 1000) with broad permissions
- Crashes in system_server cause a full system restart (soft reboot)
- The most critical process after the kernel and init

**Source locations:**

- Entry point: `frameworks/base/services/java/com/android/server/SystemServer.java`
- Services: `frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/`
- Native components: `frameworks/base/services/core/jni/`

### 1.8.10 SurfaceFlinger

**SurfaceFlinger** is the system service that composes all visible surfaces
(windows, layers) into the final image displayed on screen.

```mermaid
graph LR
    App1["App 1<br/>Window"] --> BQ1["BufferQueue"]
    App2["App 2<br/>Window"] --> BQ2["BufferQueue"]

    style HWC fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2
    style Display fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
```

**Key characteristics:**

- Receives buffers from all visible windows via `BufferQueue`
- Composites using HWC (Hardware Composer) for hardware layers and GPU for
  client composition
- Manages VSYNC timing and frame scheduling
- Supports multiple displays (internal, external, virtual)
- Critical for display performance (janky frames = visible stutter)

**Source location:** `frameworks/native/services/surfaceflinger/`

The graphics pipeline is covered in **Chapter 9**.

### 1.8.11 WindowManagerService (WMS)

**WindowManagerService** manages the window hierarchy -- determining which
windows are visible, their size and position, their z-order (stacking), input
focus, and transitions/animations.

**Key characteristics:**

- Manages all windows on all displays
- Determines window layout based on display size, insets, and system bars
- Coordinates with SurfaceFlinger for layer creation and destruction
- Manages window transitions and animations
- Enforces window policy (which windows can appear on top, focus rules)
- Works closely with ActivityTaskManagerService for activity windows

**Source location:**
`frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/wm/`

### 1.8.12 ActivityManagerService (AMS) / ActivityTaskManagerService (ATMS)

**ActivityManagerService** manages application processes, including process
lifecycle (start, stop, kill), OOM adjustment (which processes to kill under
memory pressure), and broadcast dispatch.

**ActivityTaskManagerService** (split from AMS in Android 10) manages activities,
tasks, and activity stacks -- the user-visible "task management" that determines
which activity is in the foreground, handles task switching, and manages the
recent apps list.

**Key characteristics:**

- AMS: Process lifecycle, OOM adj, broadcast dispatch, content providers,
  service binding
- ATMS: Activity lifecycle, task management, recent apps, multi-window
- Together, they are the most complex services in system_server
- The source directory `am/` contains AMS and `wm/` contains ATMS and WMS
  (reflecting the close relationship between activity and window management)

**Source locations:**

- AMS: `frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/am/`
- ATMS: `frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/wm/`

Activity and window management are covered in **Chapter 11**.

### 1.8.13 PackageManagerService (PMS)

**PackageManagerService** is responsible for everything related to APK packages:
installation, uninstallation, package queries, permission management, intent
resolution, and APK verification.

**Key characteristics:**

- Scans and indexes all installed packages at boot
- Handles APK installation (including split APKs)
- Resolves intents to target components
- Manages permissions (both install-time and runtime)
- Enforces package signing and verification
- Maintains package state (enabled/disabled components, default handlers)
- One of the most complex services in system_server

**Source location:**
`frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/pm/`

### 1.9.5 The dumpsys Command: Your Best Friend

The `dumpsys` command deserves special attention because it is the single most
useful diagnostic tool for AOSP development. It queries system services and
prints their internal state:

```bash
# List all services
adb shell dumpsys -l

# Dump a specific service (examples)
adb shell dumpsys activity              # AMS state (processes, tasks, etc.)
adb shell dumpsys activity activities   # Activity stacks only
adb shell dumpsys activity processes    # Process list with OOM adj
adb shell dumpsys window               # WMS state (windows, displays)
adb shell dumpsys window displays       # Display configuration
adb shell dumpsys package <pkg>        # Package details
adb shell dumpsys meminfo              # Memory usage by process
adb shell dumpsys battery              # Battery state
adb shell dumpsys alarm                # Alarm schedule
adb shell dumpsys jobscheduler         # Scheduled jobs
adb shell dumpsys notification         # Notification state
adb shell dumpsys audio                # Audio state
adb shell dumpsys SurfaceFlinger       # SurfaceFlinger state
adb shell dumpsys input                # Input state (devices, dispatch)
adb shell dumpsys connectivity         # Network state
adb shell dumpsys power                # Power state (wake locks, etc.)
adb shell dumpsys usagestats           # App usage statistics
```

Each system service implements a `dump()` method that outputs its current state
as human-readable text. When debugging any issue, `dumpsys` of the relevant
service is usually the first command to run.

## 1.10 Conventions Used in This Book

Throughout this book, we use the following conventions:

### 1.10.1 Source Paths

All source paths are given relative to the AOSP root directory. When we write:

```
frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/wm/WindowManagerService.java
```

This means the file is at:

```
<AOSP_ROOT>/frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/wm/WindowManagerService.java
```

Where `<AOSP_ROOT>` is the directory where you ran `repo init` and `repo sync`.
All paths in this book are relative to that root.

### 1.10.2 Code Listings

Code listings include the language identifier and, where relevant, the source
file path:

```java
// frameworks/base/core/java/android/app/Activity.java
public void startActivity(Intent intent) {
    this.startActivity(intent, null);
}
```

When code is abbreviated, ellipses (`...`) indicate omitted sections:

```java
public class ActivityManagerService extends IActivityManager.Stub {
    // ... hundreds of fields ...

    @Override
    public void startActivity(...) {
        // ... implementation ...
    }
}
```

### 1.10.3 Shell Commands

Shell commands are prefixed with `$` for user commands and `#` for root
commands:

```bash
$ adb shell                      # Connect to device shell
$ source build/envsetup.sh       # Set up build environment
# setenforce 0                   # Disable SELinux (root required)
```

### 1.10.4 Mermaid Diagrams

This book makes extensive use of Mermaid diagrams for architecture
visualizations, sequence diagrams, and flow charts. These diagrams can be
rendered by any Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid (including GitHub,
GitLab, and most modern documentation tools).

### 1.10.5 Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **AOSP** | Android Open Source Project |
| **Framework** | The Java/Kotlin layer in system_server and the `android.*` APIs |
| **Native** | C/C++ code (as opposed to Java/Kotlin) |
| **HAL** | Hardware Abstraction Layer |
| **Service** | A system service running in system_server (Java) or as a standalone daemon (native) |
| **Process** | An OS-level process with its own PID and memory space |
| **Binder service** | A service accessible over Binder IPC |
| **Client** | The process that calls a Binder service |
| **Server** | The process that hosts a Binder service implementation |
| **SoC** | System on Chip (e.g., Qualcomm Snapdragon, MediaTek Dimensity) |
| **OEM** | Original Equipment Manufacturer (device maker, e.g., Samsung, Xiaomi) |
| **BSP** | Board Support Package (kernel + drivers for a specific SoC) |
| **CTS** | Compatibility Test Suite |
| **VTS** | Vendor Test Suite |
| **GMS** | Google Mobile Services |
| **CDD** | Compatibility Definition Document |
| **GKI** | Generic Kernel Image |
| **GSI** | Generic System Image |

## 1.11 Summary

This chapter established the foundational knowledge needed to work with AOSP:

1. **AOSP is the open-source base** on which the Android ecosystem is built.
   Google adds GMS (proprietary). OEMs add customizations. The community builds
   alternative distributions. Understanding which layer you are working in is
   essential.

2. **Android's architecture is a layered stack**, from the Linux kernel through
   HALs, native services, the ART runtime, framework services (system_server),
   the public API, and applications. Each layer has clear responsibilities and
   well-defined interfaces to adjacent layers.

3. **The source tree is vast but organized.** The 30+ top-level directories each
   serve a specific purpose: `art/` for the runtime, `bionic/` for the C library,
   `frameworks/` for the application framework, `hardware/` for HAL interfaces,
   `system/` for core system components, `packages/` for applications and
   modules, `build/` for the build system, and so on.

4. **The ecosystem is a collaboration** between Google (framework, CTS, Mainline),
   SoC vendors (kernel, HALs, drivers), OEMs (customization, device bring-up),
   and the community (custom ROMs, bug reports, contributions).

5. **Android has evolved dramatically** over 15+ years and 35 API levels, with
   major architectural shifts including the move from Dalvik to ART, Project
   Treble for the vendor split, Project Mainline for modular updates, and GKI
   for kernel standardization.

6. **The developer's journey** starts with downloading and building the source,
   progresses through understanding the architecture, and advances to modifying,
   testing, and contributing to the platform.

7. **Core concepts** -- Binder, HAL, AIDL, HIDL, APEX, Mainline, ART, Zygote,
   system_server, SurfaceFlinger, WMS, AMS, PMS -- are the vocabulary of AOSP
   development. You will encounter them in every chapter that follows.

In the next chapter, we will roll up our sleeves and set up a complete AOSP
development environment: installing dependencies, downloading the source,
configuring the build, and running our first build on an emulator.
